# Modus-Collab

This is the 3rd party collaboration site for the Modus Design System. Our goal here is to allow people from the Cubic community to share software they've built for Modus. In this document, you'll learn about the Modus Design System, ideal component types, and how to contribute your own software.

## What is Modus?

Modus is a design system that incorporates UI/UX guidance and re-usable components based on that guidance. Modus has styles, icons, and advice on how to lay out your applications. We're actively implementing components for React and Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) that follow Modus Design.

For more information on what Modus offers and current status, please visit the [Modus Design Sytem Web Site](http://design.cubic.com/).

## Ideal Component Types

Ideally, we would like to build out our library of React components. We have several components done and in the pipeline and will happily accept yours. While our focus is on React components, we welcome contributions to any technology, such as WPF, Angular, or VueJS. Additionally, your contributions don't need to be just components. Any software, icons, or other resource that relates to Modus that you would like to share is welcome.

## How to Contribute

When you decide to contribute something to Modus, please use the following procedure:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a new branch.
3. Add your code to your new branch (more on this in a bit)
4. Push that branch back to the modus-collab site.
5. Submit a Pull Request

When adding your code, please note that we've divided the repository into technology related folders. Please use a technology related folder at the top level to help organize the code. Using another subfolder for your code can be helpful to to make it easy to see only the files you've submitted.

## Legal

We're currently working on a legal statement, but the gist of what we want is to be able to use contributed code as part of the Modus Design System without any constraints. More to follow on this.

A note on dependencies:

Please be aware of what external library dependencies submitted code relies upon and ensure they follow Cubic security guidelines and are available for use under licensing agreements.
